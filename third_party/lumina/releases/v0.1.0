# v0.1.0

## Overview

v0.1.0 is the first tagged release of Lumina. It establishes the public C++ API surface, and a baseline set of backends, formats, and extensions.

## Audience

- Users integrating Lumina via the public C++ API.
- Users building indexes and serving online search.

## Status

Stable (initial release).

## Changes

- Features:
  - Public "narrow waist" APIs: `LuminaBuilder` and `LuminaSearcher` with unified `Options` and `IO` abstraction.
  - Backends: `diskann`, `ivf`, `bruteforce`.
  - Extensions:
    - Search-time filtering via `SearchWithFilterExtension` (DiskANN/Bruteforce).
    - Experimental build-time checkpoint extension (DiskANN/Bruteforce builders).
  - Persisted artifacts: `.lmi` section-based container format with CRC32C (optional per-section verification).
  - Memory management: per-instance memory resource config and session pool support for avoiding heap allocations.

## Migration Notes

- This is the initial tagged release. If upgrading from an earlier untagged snapshot, rebuild indexes and checkpoints.

## Known Issues

- IVF: only `L2` metric is supported currently.
- DiskANN: dynamic updates (incremental insert/delete) are not supported.
- Builder: `LuminaBuilder` instances are not thread-safe.
- IO: `.lmi` and backend layouts may change; upgrades may require rebuilding indexes.
